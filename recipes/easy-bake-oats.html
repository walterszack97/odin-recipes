        <h2>Description</h2>

           They're super easy to make and are prepared in the blender in just a few minutes!</p>
        
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g porridge oats</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 banana, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li>1 tbsp maple syrup or honey</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>If youâ€™re baking the oatmeal in the oven, start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Or skip this step for microwave oatmeal.</p>
        <p>Stir the rolled oats, baking powder, salt, milk of choice, banana or applesauce, sweetener, and optional nut butter together. Blend if desired.</p>

        <p>Pour the baked oatmeal batter into a heat safe dish. If you want a gooey center inside, use a deeper dish or large mug. Otherwise choose a wide and shallow dish.</p>
        <p>Bake 25 minutes on the oven center rack, or microwave one to two minutes. Apply toppings as desired, and enjoy.</p>
